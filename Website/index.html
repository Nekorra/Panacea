        <h2>About Breast Cancer</h2>
        <p>
            Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.

            Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules.

            Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.

        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            Project Cybele aims to accurately provide patients with a credible software platform that not only enhances communication of certain health aspects, but also assists in affirming possible health cases. At its basis, Cybele allows
            for patients and doctors to better communicate through a texting interface. The doctor also has the ability to upload important information, such as blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and chemotherapy results. In addition,
            once doctors upload MRI Scans, Cybele checks, not only for cancer, but also if chemotherapy is benefiting the health of the patient.
